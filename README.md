# CPChallenge: iPhone Todo List

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/rahito/pen/LYwNgVB](https://codepen.io/rahito/pen/LYwNgVB).

This is a basic to-do list application that saves your items directly in your browser's local storage. It allows you to
* Add new items to your list.
* Re-arrange items for easy prioritization.
* Mark items as completed 
* Track progress.
* Delete items when no longer needed.

Key Features:
* The list automatically persists your data using local storage, so your items will remain saved even if you close or refresh your browser.
* Reset Button: To clear the list and remove all saved data, simply press the "Reset" button. This will delete all entries from local storage and reset the form.

Note:
Once items are added, they will remain in your list across browser sessions until you manually reset or delete them.
